# 📖 Teamwork Manager App

**This is a project to create a basic app where you can:**
- Create, edit and manage teams 👥
- Create, edit and manage tasks 📋
- Set due dates for tasks 📆
- Assign tasks to other users ➡️👤

The project has been created using NextJS. This framework provides the possibility to easily
implement SSR and SSG.
In this particular project, I have used SSR to check for authentication and protect routes
where tasks and teams are visible. Additionally, cookies are set to improve the UX and
maintain the routes on refresh.
